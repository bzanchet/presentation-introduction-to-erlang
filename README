Introduction to Erlang


This is a short introduction to erlang to be presented next Thurday (5-28-2009) at Yahoo! Brasil office.

There's also a short piece of code showing some capabilities of the erlang runtime. They're loosely based on examples given by Kevin Smith in the "Erlang in Practice" screencasts - more info at http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice.
